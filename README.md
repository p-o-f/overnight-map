# [Overnight Map](https://www.247map.app)

[This](https://finviz.com/map.ashx), but with 24/5 data where applicable. Hosted on a Google Cloud VM (Compute Engine) instance.

To do:
- add basic db to track # of unique visits
- fix scaling so figures can actually render on mobile
- add auto-start on boot / auto-restart on crash (via systemd; currently using t-mux + manual reboots if something goes wrong)

Some samples of what this looks like (these may be outdated, but the general idea is there).
